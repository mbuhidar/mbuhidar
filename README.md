By profession, I'm a product development engineer working to develop construction machines, but I'm also working to learn software development using modern tools and languages. Currently focused on learning Python along with its surrounding ecosystem.

I am an open-source enthusiast. I have learned so much from the open-source community and I am excited about how it brings developers together from all around the world. I also enjoy helping people learn new things and solve problems.

My primary projects relate to modernizing the experience of typing in Commodore 64 games from magazines popular in the 80's (throwback to my coding interests when I was in middle/high school).  Using those projects mostly to learn by creating something "real" to hone not only Python skills, but also learning/knowledge for C64 BASIC, Assembly, Pytest, Git, Github, releasing projects on PyPi, and so many other things.
